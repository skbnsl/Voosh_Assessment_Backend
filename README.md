we can create user with email, password,phone,bio, and user specify that user_role is required that he is user or admin.and his profile is public or not.

we can login with email and password ,where we check user's credintials. and user can update their profile and can not update her role and emailid;

and we create a middleware for the authorizaton token for user is valid or not. user can get profiles that are public. and admin can get all users profiles.

user can update their profile and can't update their emailid.

I have added signout functionality.
